Hi OpenShift Team,
We need help with an SCC issue in our Snorkel Flow deployment. JupyterHub can't spawn user notebook pods because the service account lacks permission to create pods without hardcoded UIDs.
Request: Please add the service account snorkelflow-jupyterhub-user-sa in namespace snorkelflow to the anyuid SCC.
Background: JupyterHub creates temporary notebook pods for users, but these pods are getting blocked during admission because they don't specify explicit runAsUser values (which is normal for this type of workload).
This is a standard JupyterHub pattern where users get individual notebook environments. The pods don't need privileged access - just the ability to run with auto-assigned UIDs.
Let me know if you need any additional details. We can test immediately once this is configured.
