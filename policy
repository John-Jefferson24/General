## Network Policy Update: Multi-Project PyPI Access

### Problem
New JupyterHub projects (ffep, bbg) couldn't access the shared PyPI server because they weren't covered by existing network policies.

### Solution
Updated the `podSelector` in the internal-only network policy to include new project labels, enabling access to shared infrastructure.

### Changes Made
- **File**: `internal-only-networkpolicy.yaml`
- **Change**: Updated `podSelector.matchLabels.project` from `reverse-dictionary` to `ffep` (and `bbg` in separate instances)
- **Template Variable**: Added `EGRESS_LABEL` = `reverse-dictionary` for shared services targeting

### How It Works
1. **Policy Inheritance**: New project pods now inherit permissions from all 3 existing network policies:
   - Internal access to shared services (PyPI, APIs)
   - DNS resolution capabilities  
   - SSO/Fed authentication access

2. **Shared Services Model**: 
   - PyPI server retains `project=reverse-dictionary` label
   - New projects can access it via `egress.to.podSelector.project=reverse-dictionary`
   - Maintains security boundary while enabling cross-project resource sharing

### Security Impact
✅ **Maintained**: HTTP internet browsing still blocked  
✅ **Maintained**: Only specific external access allowed (DNS, SSO)  
✅ **Enhanced**: New projects get same security profile as original

### Template Usage
```yaml
egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          project: ${EGRESS_LABEL}  # "reverse-dictionary"
```

This approach scales cleanly for future projects while maintaining the proven 3-policy security architecture.
